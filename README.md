## 📊 Modules Overview

### 1️⃣ Risk Classification
Classifies insurance applicants into risk categories using logistic regression and deep learning models.

### 2️⃣ Insurance Claim Prediction
Predicts the likelihood of a customer making a claim using demographic and policy data.

### 3️⃣ Customer Segmentation
Clusters customers based on income, premium paid, policy upgrades, and claim frequency.

### 4️⃣ Fraud Detection
Detects fraudulent claims using binary classification techniques and suspicious flag analysis.

### 5️⃣ Multilingual Insurance Policy
Translates insurance documents into **French** and **Spanish** using translation APIs. Also summarizes documents using transformer-based models.

### 6️⃣ Sentiment Analysis
Analyzes and classifies customer reviews into **Positive**, **Neutral**, or **Negative** sentiments.

### 7️⃣ Text Summarization
Uses transformer-based models like BART and Pegasus to summarize long policy documents.

### 8️⃣ AI-Powered Automated Response
Generates intelligent, context-aware replies to customer queries using rule-based and AI logic.
